Looked at was needed to do to setup this up properly. I setup the tests I needed on postman, loaded up the database the application needed and changed the password in the application so it would run the database on my computer. I Wrote down what issues were problems still in the application and planned for what I would do the next time I would work on the project.

 CategoriesDao and categoriesController are now functioning for the most part. The add function isn't working yet and there is duplicates showing up when pulling up all categories. Will hopefully be fixed by tommrow.
